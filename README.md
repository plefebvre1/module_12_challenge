# module_12_challenge
Module 12 challenge repository containing creation and analysis of two models to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers. A full analysis report is included [here](https://github.com/plefebvre1/module_12_challenge/blob/main/Credit%20Risk%20Analysis%20Report.md) that explains that the model trained on oversampled data performs better at this task than the one trained on the original data.

## Technologies

This project leverages Python 3.7 in Jupyter Lab with the following packages:

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - For financial data analysis tools
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) - For numerical functions to aid in financial calculations
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) - To create models for fitting data and making predictions

## Contributors

Starter code for this app was provided by the GWU Fintech Bootcamp program. Updates to that code to fulfill the analysis were done by Peter Lefebvre (peter.c.lefebvre@gmail.com).
